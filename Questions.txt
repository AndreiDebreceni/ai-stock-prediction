Dataset:
- we need to get a dataset 
- we need to create a data frame to analise the data:
- inspect the dataset and see how features look like.


Data processing:
- check the data for duplicates
- check for unique data    
- check for data integrity
- transform the data

Neural network:
- implement RNN networks
- train the model





Questions:

What type of RNN we use?
How do we build the network ? (input, output) How it should look?
How we will predict the data?
How do we use the predictions?
Can we predict future stock prices?
